# Changelog

## Executive Summary

- Enhanced stock data API with real-time fetching from Yahoo Finance.
- Added fallback realistic mock data generation for stock and company overview endpoints.
- Improved error handling and logging for robustness.
- Implemented comprehensive CORS policy based on environment variable.
- Added global error handlers for common HTTP errors with JSON responses.
- Introduced detailed institutional ownership data simulation.
- Provided enriched company overview including financial metrics, price trends, and employee data.
- Enabled historical stock data retrieval with fallback to generated realistic mock history.

## File-by-File Breakdown

### backend/application.py

- Added CORS configuration with environment variable support.
- Created endpoints:
  - `/api/stock` for live and mock stock price and metrics.
  - `/api/stock/history` for historical trading data retrieval.
  - `/api/company` for detailed company overview and institutional ownership.
- Integrated direct Yahoo Finance API calls with request headers.
- Realistic mock data generators for stock quotes, historical data, and company overview.
- Logging for errors and fallback scenarios.
- Input validation for stock symbols.
- Root endpoint `/` for basic health check.
- Global error handlers for HTTP 400, 404, 405, 500.
- Implemented server start logic on port 5001 to avoid port conflict.

## Technical Details and Reasoning

- Yahoo Finance API chosen for reliable, real-time market data without requiring API keys.
- Mock data ensures API reliability during external API failures or network issues.
- Institutional holdings simulated to provide realistic ownership data enhancing company profiles.
- CORS settings secured by environment variable allowing selective frontend origins.
- Thorough error handling to provide meaningful API responses and maintain user experience.
- Logging critical errors to a log file for easier debugging and monitoring.

## Impact Analysis

- External HTTP dependency on Yahoo Finance introduces network latency and dependency risks.
- Mock data path guarantees availability even when external sources fail.
- Realistic data improves client app features such as stock analytics, portfolio simulation.
- Enhanced CORS improves frontend-backend interaction security.
- Global error handling improves API reliability and debuggability.

## Testing Recommendations

- Automated tests for API endpoints with mocks for external Yahoo Finance calls.
- Validation of fallback data generation correctness and realism.
- CORS configuration testing across different environment setups.
- Error response verification on invalid inputs and simulated failures.
- Load testing of API endpoints to check performance under concurrent requests.

## Migration Notes

- No database or schema changes needed.
- Environment variable `FRONTEND_URL` should be added for production deployments to restrict CORS origins.

## Security Implications

- Proper sanitization and validation of stock symbol inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- CORS policy prevents unauthorized frontend origins from accessing the API.
- Secure handling of errors without leaking stack traces in production.

## Performance Impact

- Network calls to Yahoo Finance add latency; caching could be considered in future iterations.
- Mock data generation is lightweight and fast.
- Application designed to handle concurrent requests efficiently with Flask threaded mode.
