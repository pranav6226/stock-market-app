# Changelog for Dark Mode Toggle Feature

## Added

- Flask-CORS dependency added for backend
- New API endpoints in backend/application.py for getting and setting user theme preferences
- React component `ThemeToggle` to toggle between light/dark themes with persistence
- Theme state is persisted in backend per user ID
- Basic error handling for theme API requests
- Theme applied to document body attribute `data-theme` for CSS-based theme changes

## How to Use

- Use the `ThemeToggle` component in your React app and pass the authenticated user's ID as `userId` prop
- The toggle button calls backend to persist user preference
- On app load, theme preference is fetched and applied automatically

## Notes

- Authentication and user ID management should be integrated as per app specifics
- This implementation assumes a working user ID context
- Further UI styling for themes to be added separately
