# Pull Request Description

## Motivation and Problem Statement

The existing stock and company data backend lacked reliable real-time data delivery and fallback mechanisms. There was no detailed company overview or historical data support, impacting the quality and reliability of the client application.

## Solution Overview

Implemented a Flask backend API integrating direct calls to Yahoo Finance for stock price, historical data, and company overview information. Added sophisticated fallback mock data generation ensuring continuous availability. Enhanced error handling, logging, and CORS security.

## Technical Implementation Details

- Created `/api/stock` endpoint to fetch live stock data or fallback mock data if external API fails.
- Developed `/api/stock/history` to provide detailed historical stock prices with various period and interval options.
- Implemented `/api/company` endpoint delivering comprehensive company details including financial metrics, price trends, employee counts, and institutional ownership.
- Mock data generators for stock quotes, historical data, and institutional holders to simulate realistic data.
- CORS configured via environment variable `FRONTEND_URL`.
- Global error handlers for HTTP 400, 404, 405, and 500 to provide user-friendly JSON errors.
- Logging setup to record backend errors to `backend_error.log`.
- Root route `/` to verify server health.
- Server configured to run on port 5001, avoiding conflicts.

## Testing Strategy

- Manual testing of API endpoints with valid and invalid requests.
- Simulated external API failures to verify fallback mock data served correctly.
- Logging verification for error scenarios.
- Unit and integration tests planned for mocking external requests and response parsing.
- CORS behavior tested with various frontend origins.

## Performance Impact

- External API calls introduce variable latency; no caching currently implemented.
- Mock data generation is performant and enables consistent response times.
- Flask threaded mode used to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Security Considerations

- Input validation restricts stock symbol formats preventing injection attacks.
- CORS origin configuration restricts API access to allowed frontends only.
- Error handlers avoid exposing sensitive server internals in error responses.

## Breaking Changes

- None. This is an additive backend feature.

## Migration Guide

- Add environment variable `FRONTEND_URL` to production environment to configure allowed CORS origins.
- Port change to 5001 for backend server requires frontend updates if hardcoded.

## Rollback Plan

- Revert to previous stable backend commit.
- Remove or disable new routes if needed.

## Future Roadmap

- Add caching layers for external API data.
- Enhance input validation with whitelisting and rate limiting.
- Add authentication for sensitive data endpoints.
- Expand company overview with ESG and sustainability data.
- Provide data in additional formats such as CSV.
