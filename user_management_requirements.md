# User Management System Requirements Breakdown

## Features

1. User Registration
   - Create new user accounts with validation
   - Password strength enforcement
   - Email verification (send verification link/email)

2. User Login
   - Authenticate user credentials
   - Provide session or token on login

3. Profile Management
   - View user profile
   - Update user profile details (name, email, etc.)

4. Password Reset
   - Request password reset (send email with reset link)
   - Perform password reset using token/link

5. Email Verification
   - Verify user email via link/token
   - Restrict certain actions until email is verified

6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Define roles (admin, user, etc.)
   - Restrict access based on roles

7. Session Management
   - Manage user sessions (login, logout, expiration)

8. Security Features
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse (login attempts, registrations)
   - Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.)

## Notes
- Implementation should ensure privacy and security best practices.
- Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, argon2).
- Use secure token generation for email verification and password reset.
- Sessions or JWT should have proper expiry and revocation mechanisms.
