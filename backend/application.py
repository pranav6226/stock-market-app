You are adding centralized error handling to your Flask application by defining an error handler function and registering a general exception handler. This is a good practice to replace repetitive try-except blocks and avoid leaking internal error details to clients.

Here is how you can integrate the new error handling functions into your existing code:

### Integration steps:

1. Add the following handler functions near the top (after imports or after the Flask `application` initialization):

```python
def handle_api_error(e):
    response = jsonify({"error": str(e)})
    response.status_code = (e.code if hasattr(e, 'code') else 500)
    return response


@application.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_general_error(error):
    application.logger.error(f"Unhandled Exception: {error}")
    application.logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
    response = jsonify({"error": "An internal error has occurred. Please try again later."})
    response.status_code = 500
    return response
```

2. Remove the individual `try-except` blocks and manual except-based error responses inside your route handlers (like `/api/stock`, `/api/company`, `/api/stock/history`), or keep only critical expected error handling for graceful fallbacks (like your mock data fallback).

3. The new `@application.errorhandler(Exception)` function will catch all uncaught exceptions and respond with a generic error message and a 500 status code, logging the traceback for debugging.

4. The `handle_api_error` function you defined can be registered with specific Flask HTTP exceptions if you want, for example:

```python
from werkzeug.exceptions import HTTPException

@application.errorhandler(HTTPException)
def handle_http_exception(e):
    return handle_api_error(e)
```

Or register it explicitly for specific error codes you want centralized.

### Notes:

- Since you are already returning fallback mock data for your stock and company routes in case of errors, the centralized error handler is mainly for unexpected errors not caught inside these blocks.

- Keep logging or printing inside the code or replace prints with `application.logger` calls for consistent logging behavior.

### Example snippet showing usage in route:

Before:

```python
try:
    # code that may throw an exception
except Exception as e:
    print(f"GENERAL ERROR: {str(e)}")
    print(traceback.format_exc())
    api_response = jsonify({"error": str(e)})
    api_response.status_code = 500
    return api_response
```

After:

```python
# you can remove try/except and rely on error handler, or keep for fallback logic.
```

---

### Summary

Adding this centralized error handling improves maintainability and security by avoiding raw exception information in HTTP responses and allows cleaner route handler code. Make sure to test error scenarios to verify the handlers work correctly.
