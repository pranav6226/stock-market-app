Create comprehensive documentation:

1. Generate a detailed changelog.md file with:
   - Executive summary of all changes
   - File-by-file breakdown of modifications
   - Technical details and reasoning
   - Impact analysis
   - Testing recommendations
   - Migration notes
   - Security implications
   - Performance impact

2. Create a detailed PR description with:
   - Motivation and problem statement
   - Solution overview
   - Technical implementation details
   - Testing strategy
   - Performance impact
   - Security considerations
   - Breaking changes
   - Migration guide
   - Rollback plan
   - Future roadmap

IMPORTANT: Actually create the changelog.md file in the repository root with real content based on the analysis and changes made. Do not just provide templates.

Be extremely thorough and detailed. Use the analysis from Phase 1 to create specific, relevant documentation.
