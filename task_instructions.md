You are an autonomous coding agent. Your task is to:

1. Refactor the Flask backend to improve error handling. Add user-friendly error messages, catch and log exceptions, and ensure all API endpoints return consistent error responses. Add or improve error logging where appropriate.
2. After making all code changes, generate a detailed changelog in a new file named 'changelog.md' in the root directory. The changelog should summarize all changes, affected files, and the reasoning behind each change in a clear, human-readable format.
3. Generate a very detailed pull request description summarizing the motivation, implementation details, and testing instructions. Use the contents of 'changelog.md' as the PR body.
4. Do NOT attempt to commit, push, or create pull requests. Only edit or create files in the working directory. Output a summary of your changes.
5. Do NOT ask for user input or clarifications. If you are unsure, make reasonable assumptions and proceed autonomously.
