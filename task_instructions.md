You are an autonomous coding agent. Your task is to:

1. COMPREHENSIVE CODE ANALYSIS: Thoroughly analyze the entire codebase, including:
   - Backend structure and architecture
   - Frontend components and styling
   - Database models and relationships
   - API endpoints and their functionality
   - Error handling patterns
   - Security considerations
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Code quality and maintainability

2. IMPLEMENT ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING: Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application:
   - Global error handlers for Flask backend
   - Try-catch blocks for all API endpoints
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Error logging and monitoring
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Database error handling
   - Network timeout handling

3. CREATE DETAILED CHANGELOG: Generate an extremely detailed changelog.md file that includes:
   - Executive Summary: High-level overview of all changes
   - Detailed Changes by File: List every file modified with specific changes
   - Technical Details: Explain the reasoning behind each change
   - Impact Analysis: How changes affect functionality, performance, and security
   - Testing Recommendations: What should be tested and how
   - Migration Notes: Any breaking changes or required updates
   - Future Considerations: Suggestions for further improvements
   - Code Quality Metrics: Lines added/removed, complexity changes
   - Security Implications: Any security improvements or considerations
   - Performance Impact: Speed, memory, or resource usage changes

4. GENERATE COMPREHENSIVE PR DESCRIPTION: Create a very detailed pull request description that includes:
   - Motivation: Why these changes are necessary
   - Problem Statement: What issues are being addressed
   - Solution Overview: How the changes solve the problems
   - Technical Implementation: Detailed explanation of the code changes
   - Testing Strategy: How to test the changes
   - Performance Impact: Any performance improvements or concerns
   - Security Considerations: Security improvements or risks
   - Breaking Changes: Any API or interface changes
   - Migration Guide: Steps to deploy and migrate
   - Rollback Plan: How to revert if needed
   - Future Roadmap: Next steps and improvements

5. CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS: Ensure all code follows best practices:
   - Consistent coding style
   - Proper documentation
   - Type hints where applicable
   - Unit tests for new functionality
   - Code comments for complex logic
   - Performance optimizations
   - Security best practices

6. DOCUMENTATION: Update or create:
   - README updates
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guides
   - Configuration examples
   - Troubleshooting guides

Be extremely thorough and detailed in your analysis and documentation. This is a production system that needs comprehensive error handling and detailed documentation for maintainability.

Output a complete summary of all changes made, including file-by-file breakdown and technical rationale.
